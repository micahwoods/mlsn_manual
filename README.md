## Progress notes

I started this in 2021-05 rather excited about easily taking HTML files and converting to markdown with pandoc.

But, the pandoc formatting is not standard markdown, the whole thing is hard to edit. So I am going to try again now from 2021-09-13 to:

* take plain text
* delete the time sensitive and links and so on.
* keep the essayish type stuff. And have ourselves an ebook.

And generated the first version on 2021-09-14.
