# Preface {-}

Four months ago I sent out the 15^th^ MLSN newsletter to more than 1,000 subscribers. By the way, you can [subscribe here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/#newsletters). These newsletters have been written with a goal of explaining MLSN, and include some stories about how Larry Stowell and I got started with MLSN, examples of how it works, and explanations of why it works. 

After 15 of those, I realized it's a lot of reading material, and that an easy way to make them available for reference would be as a book(let). I've edited the original newsletters by removing as much time-specific material---such as seminar announcements---as I could, while trying to keep and arrange the expositional essay parts. I hope you'll find this useful and thought-provoking. For more, be sure to check out the [MLSN information hub](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/mlsn/) on the ATC website.
